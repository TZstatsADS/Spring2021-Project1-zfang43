### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2021

+ Projec title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
+ This project is conducted by Zi Fang

+ Project summary: [Year 2020 has been full of surprises. Some people say 2020 is a magic year since so many things that you would never think about happened. The 2020 Presidential Election and the COVID-19 pandemic are two of the most important things that closely related to people in the United States. In this project, I will discuss How accurate did the votes be counted in 2020 Election, How did Trump's Approval Rating Change between 2016 and 2020, how well did president Trump handle his job in the past four years and is the data collected reliable.] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Following [suggestions](http://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-projects/) by [RICH FITZJOHN](http://nicercode.github.io/about/#Team) (@richfitz). This folder is orgarnized as follows.

One of the dataset can not be uploaded under the data folder because the the sav file is too big, therefore, I provide the google drive sharing link here: 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FJ03SvcGKuUs9-s41cuT_DLGoS5HkYa9/view?usp=sharing

You can easily access the file using your lionmail account. Thank you.

Please see each subfolder for a README file.
