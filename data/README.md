# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on the Presidential Elections in the US

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

One of the dataset can not be uploaded under the data folder because the the sav file is too big, therefore, I provide the google drive sharing link here: 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FJ03SvcGKuUs9-s41cuT_DLGoS5HkYa9/view?usp=sharing

You can easily access the file using your lionmail account. Thank you.
